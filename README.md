# Machine Learning vs Initial Public Offerings
Authors: Amandeep Kaur, Nitin Thomas, Prabhdyal Singh, Rabih Raymond Antoun, Matthew Phan

# Project Overview
 Machine Learning libraries with ensemble methods(adaboost), gradient boosting(xgboost), decision trees(random forest generator)
 and deep learning neural networks (long term short term memory) , regression models (K-Nearest Neighbour), confusion matrices 
 (multiclassification) shall predict the outcomes of positive or negative returns of new companies.
 
# Data Preperatrion
 Get IPO data manually from up to 2018 from iposcoop.com with internet wayback machine, and then using yahoo finance to merge 
 the SPY index with this using features 10 , 84 days before the IPO, and 100 days after.
 
# Detailed Usage / Installation
  Main file code is inside a Jupyter Notebook with deep learning libraries imported. Seperate dataframes using dates 10 days before,
  84 days before, and 100 days after an offer date is used to merge with a yahoo finance spy index and then having returns calculated.
  *note this can take 25 minutes for processing*
  
  Encoding of the returns was neccessary for using non negative values in the maching learning libraries.
