# Project Overview
 Machine Learning libraries with ensemble methods(adaboost), gradient boosting(xgboost), decision trees(random forest generator)
 and neural networks (long term short term memory) , regression models (K-Nearest Neighbour), confusion matrices (multiclassification)
 shall predict the outcomes the positive or negative returns of new companies.
 
# Data Preperatrion
 Get IPO data manually from up to 2018 from iposcoop.com , and then using yahoo finance to merge the SPY index with this
 using features 10 , 84 days before the IPO, and 100 days after.
 
# Detailed Usage / Installation
  Main file code is inside a Jupyter Notebook with deep learning libraries imported,
